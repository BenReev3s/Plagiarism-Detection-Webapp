## How the Plagiarism Checker works?

- The Plagiarism Checker uses a simple UI giving the user a choice to select files or drop and drag them

- A dir(uploads) contains all files uploaded. Files uploaded are given unique id's and resorted so the most recently uploaded file is compared

- The app allows multiple file upload and will compare the most recently uploaded file against the rest of files

- user can uplaod multiple files and then upload a single file after that they want to compare against the rest. The most similar files content is shown on the left of the drop box. A list of the files used in comparison is found below the drop box with a given rating of similarity from 0 - 1
